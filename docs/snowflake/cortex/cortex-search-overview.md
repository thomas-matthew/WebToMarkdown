# Cortex Search[¶](#cortex-search)

Get started with Cortex Search

[Try it in Snowsight](https://app.snowflake.com/_deeplink/#/cortex/search?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=growth&utm_campaign=-us-en-all&utm_content=-app-user-guide-snowflake-cortex-cortex-search-cortex-search-overview)

## Overview[¶](#overview)

Cortex Search enables low-latency, high-quality “fuzzy” search over your Snowflake data.
It powers a broad array of search experiences for Snowflake users
including [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation)
applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

Cortex Search gets you up and running with a hybrid (vector and keyword) search engine on your text data in minutes, without having to
worry about embedding, infrastructure maintenance, search quality parameter tuning, or ongoing index refreshes. This means you can spend
less time on infrastructure and search quality tuning, and more time developing high-quality chat and search
experiences using your data. Check out the [Cortex Search tutorials](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/overview-tutorials)
for step-by-step instructions on using Cortex Search to power AI chat and search applications.

## When to use Cortex Search[¶](#when-to-use-cortex-search)

The two primary use cases for Cortex Search are retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and enterprise search.

* **RAG engine for LLM chatbots**: Use Cortex Search as a RAG engine for chat applications with your
  text data by leveraging semantic search for customized, contextualized responses.
* **Enterprise search**: Use Cortex Search as a backend for a high-quality search bar embedded in your application.

### Cortex Search for RAG[¶](#cortex-search-for-rag)

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for retrieving data from a knowledge base to enhance the generated
response of a large language model. The following architecture diagram shows how you can combine Cortex Search with
[Cortex LLM Functions](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/aisql) to create
enterprise chatbots with RAG using your Snowflake data as a knowledge base.

![Using Cortex Search for RAG in Snowflake](/static/images/cortex-search-rag.png)

Cortex Search is the retrieval engine that provides the Large Language Model with the context it needs
to return answers that are grounded in your most up-to-date proprietary data.

## Example: Create and query a Cortex Search service[¶](#example-create-and-query-a-cortex-search-service)

This example takes you through the steps of creating a Cortex Search Service and querying
it using the REST API. Refer to the [Querying a Cortex Search Service](#label-cortex-search-query-syntax) topic for
more details about querying the service.

This example uses a sample customer support transcript dataset.

Run the following commands to setup the example database and schema.

Copy code

```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cortex_search_db;

CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE cortex_search_wh WITH
   WAREHOUSE_SIZE='X-SMALL';

CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA cortex_search_db.services;
```

Run the following SQL commands to create the dataset.

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE support_transcripts (
    transcript_text VARCHAR,
    region VARCHAR,
    agent_id VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO support_transcripts VALUES
    ('My internet has been down since yesterday, can you help?', 'North America', 'AG1001'),
    ('I was overcharged for my last bill, need an explanation.', 'Europe', 'AG1002'),
    ('How do I reset my password? The email link is not working.', 'Asia', 'AG1003'),
    ('I received a faulty router, can I get it replaced?', 'North America', 'AG1004');
```

### Create the service[¶](#create-the-service)

You can create a Cortex Search Service with a single SQL query or from the Snowflake AI & ML Studio. When you create a
Cortex Search Service, Snowflake performs transformations on your source data to get it ready for low-latency serving. The following
sections show how to create a service using both SQL and in the Snowflake AI & ML Studio in Snowsight.

Note

When you create a search service, the search index is built as part of the create process. This means the CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE
statement may take longer to complete for larger datasets.

#### Use SQL[¶](#use-sql)

The following example demonstrates how to create a Cortex Search Service
with [CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/create-cortex-search) on the sample customer support transcript dataset created in the previous section.

Copy codeExpand

```
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE transcript_search_service
  ON transcript_text
  ATTRIBUTES region
  WAREHOUSE = cortex_search_wh
  TARGET_LAG = '1 day'
  EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0'
  AS (
    SELECT
        transcript_text,
        region,
        agent_id
    FROM support_transcripts
);
```

Show lessSee more

Scroll to top

This command triggers the building of the search service for your data. In this example:

> * Queries to the service will search for matches in the `transcript_text` column.
> * The `TARGET_LAG` parameter dictates that the Cortex Search Service will check for updates to the
>   base table `support_transcripts` approximately once per day.
> * The columns `region` and `agent_id` will be indexed so that they can be returned along with
>   results of queries on the `transcript_text` column.
> * The column `region` will be available as a filter column when querying the `transcript_text` column.
> * The warehouse `cortex_search_wh` will be used for materializing the results of the specified query initially
>   and each time the base table is changed.

Note

* Depending on the size of the warehouse specified in the query and the number of rows in
  your table, this CREATE command may take up to several hours to complete.
* Snowflake recommends using a dedicated warehouse of size no larger than MEDIUM for each service.
* Columns in the ATTRIBUTES field must be included in the source query, either via
  explicit enumeration or wildcard, ( `*` ) .

#### Use Snowsight[¶](#use-snowsight)

Follow these steps to create a Cortex Search Service in Snowsight:

1. Sign in to [Snowsight](/user-guide/ui-snowsight-gs#label-snowsight-getting-started-sign-in).
2. Choose a role that is granted the SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX\_USER database role.
3. In the navigation menu, select **AI & ML** » **Cortex Search**.
4. Select **Create**.
5. Select a role and warehouse.

   The role must be granted the SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX\_USER database role. The warehouse is used for
   materializing the results of the source query when the service is created and refreshed.
6. Select a database and schema in which the service is defined.
7. Enter a name for your service, then select **Next**.
8. Select data to be indexed.

   * To select a table or view, select **Table or view**.

     Select the table or view that contains the text data to be indexed for searching, then select **Next**. For example, select
     the `support_transcripts` table.
   * To select files from a stage, select **Stage**. (Preview)

     Select the stage that contains the files to be indexed for searching, then select **Next**.

   Note

   If you want to specify multiple data sources or perform transformations when defining your service,
   [use SQL](#label-cortex-search-overview-example-sql).
9. If you selected **Table or view**:

   * Select the columns you want included in the search results, for example, `transcript_text`, `region`, and `agent_id`, then select **Next**.
   * Select the column that will be searched, for example, `transcript_text`, then select **Next**.
   * If you want to be able to filter your search results based on particular columns, select those columns, then select **Next**.
     If you don’t need any filters, select **Skip this option**.

   If you selected **Stage** (Preview):

   * Select the destination for your processed data, then select **Next**.
10. Select the configuration parameters for the service.

Set your target lag, which is the amount of time your service content should lag behind updates to the base data, then select **Create**.

The final step confirms that your service has been created and displays the service name and its data source.

Note

When you create the service from Snowsight, the name of the service is double-quoted. For details on what that means when
referencing the service in SQL, see [Double-quoted identifiers](/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax#label-delimited-identifier).

### Grant usage permissions[¶](#grant-usage-permissions)

After the service and index are created, you can grant usage on the service, its database,
and schema to other roles like customer\_support.

Copy code

```
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE cortex_search_db TO ROLE customer_support;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA services TO ROLE customer_support;

GRANT USAGE ON CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE transcript_search_service TO ROLE customer_support;
```

### Preview the service[¶](#preview-the-service)

To confirm that the service is populated with data properly, you can preview the service via the
[SEARCH\_PREVIEW function](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#label-cortex-search-query-syntax-sql-preview) from a SQL environment:

Copy codeExpand

```
SELECT PARSE_JSON(
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
      'cortex_search_db.services.transcript_search_service',
      '{
        "query": "internet issues",
        "columns":[
            "transcript_text",
            "region"
        ],
        "filter": {"@eq": {"region": "North America"} },
        "limit":1
      }'
  )
)['results'] as results;
```

Show lessSee more

Scroll to top

Sample successful query response:

Copy code

```
[
  {
  "transcript_text" : "My internet has been down since yesterday, can you help?",
  "region" : "North America"
  }
]
```

This response confirms that the service is populated with data and serving reasonable results for the given query.

You can also use the [CORTEX\_SEARCH\_DATA\_SCAN](/sql-reference/functions/cortex_search_data_scan) table function to inspect the contents of the service.

Copy code

```
SELECT
  *
FROM
  TABLE (
    CORTEX_SEARCH_DATA_SCAN (
      SERVICE_NAME => 'transcript_search_service'
    )
  );
```

```
+ ---------------------------------------------------------- + --------------- + -------- + ------------------------------ +
|                      transcript_text                       |     region      | agent_id | _GENERATED_EMBEDDINGS_MY_MODEL |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 'My internet has been down since yesterday, can you help?' | 'North America' | 'AG1001' | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]           |
| 'I was overcharged for my last bill, need an explanation.' | 'Europe'        | 'AG1002' | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]           |
+ ---------------------------------------------------------- + --------------- + -------- + ------------------------------ +
```

### Query the service from your application[¶](#query-the-service-from-your-application)

Once you’ve created the search service, granted usage on it to your role, and previewed it, you can
now query it from your application using the [Python API](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#label-cortex-search-query-syntax-python).

The following code shows using the Python API to retrieving the support ticket most relevant to
a query about `internet issues`, filtered to return results in the `North America` region:

Copy codeExpand

```
from snowflake.core import Root
from snowflake.snowpark import Session

CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {"..."}

session = Session.builder.configs(CONNECTION_PARAMETERS).create()
root = Root(session)

transcript_search_service = (root
  .databases["cortex_search_db"]
  .schemas["services"]
  .cortex_search_services["transcript_search_service"]
)

resp = transcript_search_service.search(
  query="internet issues",
  columns=["transcript_text", "region"],
  filter={"@eq": {"region": "North America"} },
  limit=1
)
print(resp.to_json())
```

Show lessSee more

Scroll to top

Sample successful query response:

Copy code

```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "transcript_text": "My internet has been down since yesterday, can you help?",
      "region": "North America"
    }
  ],
  "request_id": "5d8eaa5a-800c-493c-a561-134c712945ba"
}
```

Cortex Search Services return all columns specified in the `columns` field in your query.

## Required privileges[¶](#required-privileges)

* To create a Cortex Search Service, your role must have the required privileges to use the Cortex embedding functions, which
  requires granting the [SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX\_USER](/sql-reference/snowflake-db-roles#label-snowflake-db-roles-cortex-user) database role
  or the [SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX\_EMBED\_USER](/sql-reference/snowflake-db-roles#label-snowflake-db-roles-cortex-embed-user) database
  role to the service creator role. You must also have the following privileges:

  + The CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE or OWNERSHIP privilege on the schema where you create the service.
  + The SELECT privilege on the underlying table(s) or view(s) that the service queries.
  + The USAGE privilege on the warehouse that refreshes the service.
* Change tracking must be enabled on all underlying objects used by a Cortex Search Service.
  For more information about change tracking requirements, see [Change Tracking Requirements](/sql-reference/sql/create-cortex-search#label-cortex-search-change-tracking-requirements).
* To query a Cortex Search Service, the role of the querying user must have USAGE privileges on the service itself,
  as well as on the database and schema in which the service resides. See [Cortex Search Access Control Requirements](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#label-cortex-search-query-syntax-access-controls).
* To suspend or resume a Cortex Search Service using the ALTER command, the role of the querying user must have the OPERATE privilege on
  the service. See [ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-cortex-search).

Important

Cortex Search Services perform searches with [owner’s rights](/developer-guide/stored-procedure/stored-procedures-rights) and follow
the same security model as other Snowflake objects that run with owner’s rights. For more information, see
[Cortex Search Access Control Requirements](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#label-cortex-search-query-syntax-access-controls)

## Understanding Cortex Search quality[¶](#understanding-cortex-search-quality)

Cortex Search leverages an ensemble of retrieval and ranking models to provide you with a high level of search quality with little to no tuning required.
Under the hood, Cortex Search takes a “hybrid” approach to retrieving and ranking documents. Each search query utilizes:

* **Vector search** for retrieving semantically similar documents.
* **Keyword search** for retrieving lexically similar documents.
* **Semantic reranking** for reranking the most relevant documents in the result set.

This hybrid retrieval approach, coupled with a semantic reranking step, achieves high search quality across a broad range of datasets and queries.

You can customize the scoring of search results by applying numeric boosts, time decays, adjusting component weights, or disabling reranking. For more information, see [Customizing Cortex Search scoring](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-customize-scoring).

### Cortex Search Embedding Models[¶](#cortex-search-embedding-models)

Cortex Search allows users to select a hosted embedding model to be leveraged in the vector search stage of retrieval.
The following embedding models are available in Cortex Search.

Important

Model pricing varies. Canonical model pricing is available in the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf). If
a price shown below differs from the price shown for the model in the Snowflake Service Consumption Table, the
Snowflake Service Consumption table shall govern.

| Model name | Output Dimensions | Context window size (tokens) | Language support | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5` (default) | 768 | 512 | English-only | Snowflake’s most practical, English-only embedding model. This open-source, 110M-parameter model yields the fastest indexing times of the available models in Cortex Search. For more information, see the [Arctic Embed 1.5 blog post](https://www.snowflake.com/en/engineering-blog/arctic-embed-m-v1-5-enterprise-retrieval) and [Arctic Embed 1.5 model card](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5). |
| `snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` | 1024 | 512 | Multilingual | Snowflake’s price-performant multilingual embedding model with a context window of 512 tokens. This open-source, 568M-parameter model yields high quality on both English and non-English datasets. For more information, see the [Arctic Embed 2 blog post](https://www.snowflake.com/en/engineering-blog/snowflake-arctic-embed-2-multilingual/) and [Arctic Embed 2 model card](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0). |
| `snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0-8k` | 1024 | 8192 | Multilingual | Snowflake’s price-performant multilingual embedding model, with an increased context window of 8000 tokens. This open-source, 568M-parameter model yields high quality on both English and non-English datasets. |
| `voyage-multilingual-2` | 1024 | 32,000 | Multilingual | Voyage’s multilingual embedding model. This model yields high quality on both English and non-English datasets. For more information, see the [Voyage Multilingual 2 blog post](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/06/10/voyage-multilingual-2-multilingual-embedding-model/) |

Some embedding models are only available in certain cloud regions for Cortex Search.
For an availability list by model by region, see [Cortex Search Regional Availability](#label-cortex-search-overview-regional-availability).

Each model has different performance, cost, context window size, and quality characteristics. Carefully review the model specifications to determine the best
model for your specific workload. Refer to the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf) for most accurate view of each model’s cost in credits per million tokens.

### Tokens, model context windows, and text splitting[¶](#tokens-model-context-windows-and-text-splitting)

A token is a sequence of characters and is the smallest unit of text that can be processed by a large language model.
As an approximation, one token is equivalent to about 3/4 of an English word, or around 4 characters.
To calculate the number of tokens in a string, use the
[COUNT\_TOKENS Cortex Function](/sql-reference/functions/count_tokens-snowflake-cortex). For example, calculating the
tokens for a string to be embedded with the `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5` model:

Copy code

```
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COUNT_TOKENS('snowflake-arctic-embed-m', '<input_text>') as token_count
```

Each vector embedding model supports a fixed size context window for text inputs, indicated in the preceding embedding
model table. During both indexing and serving, when the number of tokens in a value in the search column exceeds the
context window size, Cortex Search truncates the string to the size of the context window before embedding it into
vector space for semantic search. However, Cortex Search uses the full body of text for keyword-based retrieval.

Snowflake provides built-in functions to assist in splitting of text into smaller chunks. For more information, see
[SPLIT\_TEXT\_RECURSIVE\_CHARACTER](/sql-reference/functions/split_text_recursive_character-snowflake-cortex).

For best search results with Cortex Search, Snowflake recommends splitting the text in your search column into chunks of no more than 512 tokens (about 385 English words). While there are longer-context embedding models available today, such as `snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0-8k`, [research](https://www.snowflake.com/en/engineering-blog/impact-retrieval-chunking-finance-rag/) shows that *a smaller chunk size typically results in higher retrieval and downstream LLM response quality*. With smaller chunks, retrieval can be more precise for a given query and, in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenario, the downstream LLM receives text chunks that are more relevant to the query.

## Refreshes[¶](#refreshes)

The content served in a Cortex Search Service is based on the results of a specific query.
When the data underlying a Cortex Search Service changes, the service
updates to reflect those changes. These updates are referred to as a refresh. This process
is automated, and it involves analyzing the query that underlies the table.

Cortex Search Services have the same refresh properties as Dynamic Tables. See [Understanding dynamic table initialization and refresh](/user-guide/dynamic-tables-refresh) topic to
understand the refresh characteristics of a Cortex Search Service.

The source query for a Cortex Search Service must be a candidate for dynamic table incremental refresh. For details on those requirements,
see [Support for incremental refresh](/user-guide/dynamic-tables-limitations#label-dynamic-tables-limits-incremental-refresh). This restriction is designed to prevent any unwanted runaway costs associated
with vector embedding computation. For more information about the constructs that are not supported for dynamic table incremental refresh,
see [Supported queries for dynamic tables](/user-guide/dynamic-tables-supported-queries).





### Primary keys[¶](#primary-keys)

A primary key of a Cortex Search Service is an optional set of columns that uniquely identify each row in the source
query (that is, only one row has that exact combination of values in the designated columns). To be used with Cortex
Search Services, primary key columns must be of the [TEXT](/sql-reference/data-types-text) data type.

A primary key can be specified when creating the service as follows:

Copy code

```
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE transcript_search_service
  ON transcript_text
  PRIMARY KEY (region, agent_id)
  WAREHOUSE = cortex_search_wh
  TARGET_LAG = '1 day'
  AS (
    SELECT
        transcript_text, region, agent_id
    FROM support_transcripts
);
```

The primary key columns of existing services can be modified with `ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE ... SET PRIMARY KEY (...)`.
For detailed syntax, see [ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-cortex-search).

Services with primary keys can make use of an optimized refresh path when data underlying the service changes.
This optimized path can result in significant reductions to the cost and latency of a refresh. With this optimization
enabled, the search service periodically compacts index information generated during a refresh. You can specify a target frequency for index refreshes by setting the
`FULL_INDEX_BUILD_INTERVAL_DAYS` property on the service. For syntax details, see [CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/create-cortex-search) and [ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-cortex-search).

Note

`FULL_INDEX_BUILD_INTERVAL_DAYS` is a soft target. Full rebuilds may occur more frequently than the specified interval to optimize serving performance based on factors such as service target lag, change rate in the service source data, and overall service size.

Queries to services with primary keys may also make use of the `@primarykey` [filter operator](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#label-cortex-search-query-filter-syntax).

The set of primary key column values must be unique for each row in the source query. Duplicates are
ignored in the resulting search index.

## Multi-index Cortex Search[¶](#multi-index-cortex-search)

Cortex Search can index multiple columns or use custom vector embeddings for queries, allowing you additional flexibility in how your Cortex Search Service interprets data and responds to user requests. You should use Multi-index Cortex Search when you have a use case that features one or more of:

* **Multiple search fields**: Users need to search across different fields of a record.
* **User-provided vector embeddings**: You have pre-computed vector embeddings for one or more columns prior to
  ingestion into the Cortex Search Service.
* **Mixed search types**: You want to support searching different fields with preference to a type of search.

  + Use *text indexes* for fields where exact or fuzzy keyword matches are important. Some examples are product codes, names, and categories.
  + Use *vector indexes* for fields with longer text content where semantic understanding is valuable. Examples include product descriptions, user reviews, and support cases.
* **Field-specific relevance**: Different fields of your data should contribute differently to relevance of a search result.

For example, for a product catalog search use case, you can create a multi-index service where:

* Product names and SKUs are *text indexes* for precise lexical matching.
* Product descriptions are *vector indexes* for semantic matching.
* Category and brand names are both text *and* vector indexes to support both lexical and semantic matches.

For examples of creating a multi-index Cortex Search service, see [CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE … TEXT INDEXES .. VECTOR INDEXES](/sql-reference/sql/create-cortex-search).
For examples of querying a multi-index service, see [Query a Cortex Search service - Multi-index queries](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/query-cortex-search-service#label-cortex-search-multi-query).

### User-provided vector embeddings[¶](#user-provided-vector-embeddings)

Multi-index Cortex Search allows you to use pre-computed vector embeddings from any embedding model (including
open-source, commercial, and custom-trained models). Use user-provided vector embeddings when:

* You want to use an embedding model not natively available in Cortex Search, or you want to reuse embeddings you have
  already generate to reduce cost and improve performance.
* You want to combine your vector embeddings with Cortex Search text indexes for hybrid retrieval.

When you specify a bare column name in the VECTOR INDEXES clause, but do not specify a model, Cortex Search treats the
contents of the column as user-provided vector embeddings. User-provided vectors are indexed as-is and do not incur any
embedding cost.

Note

You cannot load vectors directly into a Snowflake table. Instead, cast an array of numbers to the VECTOR data type when inserting or updating data in the source table for your Cortex Search Service.
See [Vector conversion](/sql-reference/data-types-vector#label-data-type-vector-conversion) for details and examples of how to do this.

Cortex Search chooses one of the following modes at search time, depending on whether you provide a query vector or query text in your search request:

| Mode | Index time | Query time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully user-managed | Provide vectors in a VECTOR column | Provide a query vector via multi\_index\_query |
| User-managed with managed query embeddings | Provide vectors in a VECTOR column | Cortex Search embeds query text using the specified model |

## Suspension of indexing and serving[¶](#suspension-of-indexing-and-serving)

A Cortex Search Service has two states that can be running or suspended independently: indexing
and serving. Use [ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-cortex-search) to
manually suspend or resume indexing, serving, or both.

Indexing also suspends automatically after repeated refresh failures, as a built-in safeguard.
Separately, you can configure serving to auto-suspend after a period of query inactivity to reduce
cost on idle services.

### Indexing suspension on refresh errors[¶](#indexing-suspension-on-refresh-errors)

Much like Dynamic Tables, Cortex Search Services automatically suspend their indexing state when they encounter five
consecutive refresh failures related to the source query. If you encounter this failure for your service, you can view the specific SQL
error using either [DESCRIBE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/desc-cortex-search) or the [CORTEX\_SEARCH\_SERVICES view](/sql-reference/info-schema/cortex_search). The output from
both includes the following columns:

* The INDEXING\_STATE column, which is SUSPENDED for a suspended service.
* The INDEXING\_ERROR column, which contains the specific SQL error encountered in the source query.

Once the root issue is resolved, you can resume the service with `ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE <name> RESUME INDEXING`.
For detailed syntax, see [ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-cortex-search).

### Auto-suspend serving on inactivity[¶](#auto-suspend-serving-on-inactivity)

[Preview Feature](/release-notes/preview-features) — Open

Available to all accounts.

To reduce serving cost when a service isn’t in use, set the `AUTO_SUSPEND` property to a number
of seconds of query inactivity. After that period passes, the service automatically suspends its
serving compute, and resumes when it next receives a query. Set `AUTO_SUSPEND` when creating a
service in [CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/create-cortex-search), or on an existing service with
[ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/alter-cortex-search). Minimum: 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

You can also resume an auto-suspended service early with
`ALTER CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE <name> RESUME`. After a manual resume, the next auto-suspension can
occur only after another full `AUTO_SUSPEND` period of inactivity.

Usage notes:

* When an auto-suspended service receives a query, the first request is paused until the service
  resumes and then completes. Concurrent requests during the resume window return HTTP 429 with a
  `Retry-After` header; implement retry logic in your client to handle these responses
  gracefully.
* Resuming may take up to a few minutes. Services with smaller indexed data volumes resume faster.
* The service suspends within 5 minutes after the inactivity threshold passes.

To check whether a service is currently serving and whether auto-suspend is configured, use
[SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES](/sql-reference/sql/show-cortex-search) or [DESCRIBE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE](/sql-reference/sql/desc-cortex-search) and
look at the `SERVING_STATE` and `AUTO_SUSPEND` columns.

## Cost considerations[¶](#cost-considerations)

A Cortex Search Service incurs cost in the following ways:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Virtual warehouse compute | A Cortex Search Service requires a [virtual warehouse](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-virtual-warehouse-credit-usage) to refresh the service: to run queries against base objects when they are initialized and refreshed, including orchestrating text embedding jobs and building the search index. These operations use compute resources, which consume [credits](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-what-are-credits). If no changes are identified during a refresh, virtual warehouse credits aren’t consumed since there’s no new data to refresh. |
| EMBED\_TEXT tokens compute | A Cortex Search Service automatically embeds each text row in the search column specified in the `ON` parameter into vector space to enable semantic search, which incurs a credit cost per token embedded. This involves calling [EMBED\_TEXT\_768](/sql-reference/functions/embed_text-snowflake-cortex) or [EMBED\_TEXT\_1024](/sql-reference/functions/embed_text_1024-snowflake-cortex) to convert each document as a series of numbers that encodes its meaning. Embeddings are computed each time a row is inserted or updated. Embeddings are processed incrementally in the evaluation of the source query, so the embedding cost is only incurred for added or changed documents. See [Vector Embeddings](/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/vector-embeddings) for more information on vector embedding costs. |
| Multi-index Cortex Search | Multi-index Cortex Search Services have costs dependent on how you embed tokens and the number of columns you index. Larger embedding vectors or higher numbers of index columns incur higher costs. Embeddings are computed each time a row is inserted or updated. Embeddings are processed incrementally in the evaluation of the source query, so the embedding cost is only incurred for added or changed documents. |
| Serving compute | A Cortex Search Service uses multi-tenant serving compute, separate from a user-provided Virtual Warehouse, to establish a low-latency, high-throughput service. The compute cost for this component is incurred per GB per month (GB/mo) of uncompressed indexed data, where indexed data is the user-provided data in the Cortex Search source query, plus vector embeddings computed on the user’s behalf. You incur these costs while the service is available to respond to queries, even if no queries are served during a given period. For the Cortex Search Serving credit rate per GB/mo of indexed data, see the [Snowflake Service Consumption Table](https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf). |
| Storage | Cortex Search Services materialize the source query into a table stored in your account. This table is transformed into data structures that are optimized for low-latency serving, also stored in your account. Storage for the table and intermediate data structures are based on a flat rate per terabyte (TB). |
| Cloud services compute | Cortex Search Services use [Cloud Services compute](/user-guide/cost-understanding-compute#label-cloud-services-credit-usage) to identify changes in underlying base objects and whether the virtual warehouse needs to be invoked. Cloud services compute cost is subject to the constraint that Snowflake only bills if the daily cloud services cost is greater than 10% of the daily warehouse cost for the account. |

## Known limitations[¶](#known-limitations)

Usage of Cortex Search is subject to the following limitations:

* **Base table size**: The result of the materialized query in the search service must be
  less than 100M rows in size to maintain optimal serving performance. If the materialized result
  of your query has more than 100M rows, the creation query fails with an error.

  Note

  To increase the row scaling limits on a Cortex Search Service above 100M, please contact
  your Snowflake account team.
* **Throughput and rate limiting**: Cortex Search returns a 429 HTTP status code if a client sends requests too quickly or if the service becomes overloaded. Client logic calling the search service should implement backoff and retry logic to handle these 429 responses gracefully.

  Note

  To increase throughput beyond 20 QPS for a single search service or 140 QPS across all services in your account, contact
  your Snowflake account team.
* **Query constructs**: Cortex Search Service source queries must adhere to the same query restrictions
  that Dynamic Tables have. Please see the [Dynamic table limitations](/user-guide/dynamic-tables-limitations) for more detail.
* **Data retention**: Cortex Search Services have the same requirements as dynamic tables around data retentions.
  Specifically, you can’t set the [DATA\_RETENTION\_TIME\_IN\_DAYS](/sql-reference/parameters#label-data-retention-time-in-days) object parameter in your base tables to zero
  or set this parameter on the schema or database containing the search service. Additionally, search services
  can become stale if they are not refreshed within [MAX\_DATA\_EXTENSION\_TIME\_IN\_DAYS](/sql-reference/parameters#label-max-data-extension-time-in-days). Once stale, they must be
  recreated to resume refreshes. Please see the [Dynamic table limitations](/user-guide/dynamic-tables-limitations) for more detail.
* **Cloning**: Cortex Search Services do not currently support [cloning](/user-guide/object-clone).
  Snowflake intends to provide this capability in some future release, but cannot guarantee a specific timeline.
* **Table immutability**: While running, your Cortex Search Services require tables they access aren’t modified or dropped. To safely update tables used by a Cortex Search Service, stop the service before making your changes.
