## Compare models

If you're unsure which model to use, start with [Claude Opus 5.5](/docs/en/models/opus-5-5/overview) for most workloads. Use [Claude Fable 5.1](/docs/en/models/fable-5-1/overview) for demanding reasoning and long-horizon agentic work, or when your evals on Claude Opus 5.5 at higher effort still fall short. All current models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, vision, and tool use. Each model's page lists the platforms it's available on.

To understand how model IDs, aliases, and snapshots work, see [Model IDs and versioning](/docs/en/about-claude/models/model-ids-and-versions); for the reliable-knowledge and training-data cutoffs behind each model, see [Anthropic's Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency).

## Using the Models API

You can query model capabilities and token limits programmatically with the [Models API](/docs/en/api/models/list). The response includes `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, and a `capabilities` object for every available model.

Each model in the response also has a `line` field, which names the model line it belongs to. Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.6 both report `opus`. Use `line` to group models, for example, in a model picker. `line` is `null` when a model belongs to no line. Read `line` instead of inferring it from the model's `id`. Anthropic might add more lines, so don't treat the set of values as fixed.

Each model's `capabilities` object includes `thinking.types.disabled`, which reports whether the model accepts `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, the setting that [turns thinking off](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#turning-thinking-off). `supported` is `false` when the model rejects `"disabled"` with a 400 error, and `true` on a model that doesn't support thinking. Even when `supported` is `true`, the API can still reject a `"disabled"` request for another reason. One such reason is an [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) level that the model doesn't allow with thinking off.

## Prompt and output performance

Current Claude models excel in:

* **Performance:** Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See [Prompting best practices](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices) for general and model-specific prompting guidance.
* **Engaging responses:** Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions. If you prefer more concise responses, adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to the [prompt engineering guides](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
* **Output quality:** When migrating from a previous model generation, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance. If you're on Claude Opus 5 or earlier, see the [Claude Opus 5.5 migration guide](/docs/en/models/opus-5-5/migration-guide).
