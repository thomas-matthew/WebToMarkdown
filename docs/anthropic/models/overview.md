##  Choosing a model

If you're unsure which model to use, consider starting with **Claude Opus 4.8** for the most complex tasks. It is Anthropic's most capable Opus-tier model for complex reasoning, long-horizon agentic coding, and high-autonomy work. For workloads that need the highest available capability, see [Claude Fable 5](#claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5).

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available through the Claude API, [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock), [Google Cloud](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry).

Once you've picked a model, [learn how to make your first API call](/docs/en/get-started).

###  Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5

Claude Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`) is Anthropic's most capable widely released model. Claude Mythos 5 (`claude-mythos-5`) joins the invitation-only Claude Mythos Preview (`claude-mythos-preview`) within [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing). See [Introducing Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5](/docs/en/about-claude/models/introducing-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5) for launch details and API changes.

*1 - See [Pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for complete pricing information including Batch API discounts and prompt caching rates.*

*2 - **Reliable knowledge cutoff** indicates the date through which a model's knowledge is most extensive and reliable. **Training data cutoff** is the broader date range of training data used. For more information, see [Anthropic's Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency).*

*3 - Claude Opus 4.8 and Claude Sonnet 5 are available on Bedrock through [Claude in Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock) (the Messages-API Bedrock endpoint).*

*4 - Introductory pricing of $2 / $10 per MTok applies to Claude Sonnet 5 through August 31, 2026. See [Pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#claude-sonnet-5-introductory-pricing).*



[Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) is offered separately as a research preview model for defensive cybersecurity workflows as part of [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing). Access is invitation-only and there is no self-serve sign-up.



Every Claude model ID is a pinned snapshot. Models with a date in the ID (for example, `20250929`) are fixed to that specific release. Starting with the Claude 4.6 generation, model IDs use a dateless format that is also a pinned snapshot, not an evergreen pointer. For models before the 4.6 generation, entries in the Claude API alias column are convenience pointers that resolve to a dated model ID. For details on the naming convention and how versioning works, see [Model IDs and versioning](/docs/en/about-claude/models/model-ids-and-versions).



Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all subsequent models** (including Claude Sonnet 4.6), Bedrock offers two endpoint types: **global endpoints** (dynamic routing for maximum availability) and **regional endpoints** (guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions). Google Cloud offers three endpoint types: global endpoints, **multi-region endpoints** (dynamic routing within a geographic area), and regional endpoints. For more information, see [Cloud platform pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#cloud-platform-pricing).



**Claude Platform on AWS** uses the same model IDs as the Claude API (for example, `claude-opus-4-6`), not Bedrock-style IDs. Model lifecycle on Claude Platform on AWS follows Anthropic's first-party [Model deprecations](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations), not Bedrock's. See [Available models](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws#available-models) for the model list.



You can query model capabilities and token limits programmatically with the [Models API](/docs/en/api/models/list). The response includes `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, and a `capabilities` object for every available model.



On Claude Opus 4.8, the `effort` parameter defaults to `high` on all surfaces, including the Claude API, Claude Code, and claude.ai. On Claude Sonnet 5, it defaults to `high` on the Claude API and Claude Code. Set `effort` explicitly to use a different level. See [Effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) for guidance on choosing a level.



The Max output values above apply to the synchronous Messages API. On the [Message Batches API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing#extended-output-beta), Claude Opus 4.8, Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6, Sonnet 5, and Sonnet 4.6 support up to 300k output tokens by using the `output-300k-2026-03-24` beta header.

### Legacy models

##  Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:

* **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.
* **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.

  + If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to the [prompt engineering guides](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
  + For prompting best practices, see [Prompting best practices](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices).
* **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.

##  Migrating to Claude Opus 4.8

If you're currently using Claude Opus 4.7 or earlier Claude models, see [Migrating to Claude Opus 4.8](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide#migrating-from-claude-opus-47).

##  Migrating to Claude Opus 4.7

If you're currently using Claude Opus 4.6 or older Claude models, see [Migrating to Claude Opus 4.7](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide#migrating-to-claude-opus-4-7).
